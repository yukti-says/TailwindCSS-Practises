# ✨ Tailwind UI Practice Playground

This is Yukti’s personal space to play, learn, and build UI components using **Tailwind CSS**.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `src/` – All the HTML components go here.
  - `typography/` – First experiment! 🎉
- `dist/` – Compiled `style.css` from Tailwind
- `tailwind.config.js` – Custom Tailwind setup

## 🧠 Why I’m Doing This

To learn how to build beautiful, responsive interfaces — one tiny component at a time 💫

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo
2. Run this in terminal:

```bash
npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/style.css --watch
