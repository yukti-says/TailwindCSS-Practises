## 🎨 Tailwind Concepts Used

Each alert uses a combination of Tailwind’s utility classes to achieve:

- **Colors**: `bg-green-100`, `text-red-700`, `bg-yellow-50`, etc.
- **Spacing**: `p-4`, `mb-4`, `mt-2`
- **Typography**: `text-sm`, `font-semibold`, `leading-relaxed`
- **Borders & Rounding**: `rounded`, `border-l-4`, `shadow`
- **Positioning (Toast)**: `fixed bottom-4 right-4 z-50`
- **Transitions** *(optional)*: For smooth appearance/disappearance of toasts
